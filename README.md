# freeinvoice

A beautiful and free invoice application built for freelancers, developers and anyone else looking for a free easy to use invoicing solution.

After trying to find a free invoice generator that didn't force me to sign up, to hand over payment details or could create simple invoices, I decided to build somethng of my own.

## Running it

## Technical

This app is built using Aurelia 2. It leverages IndexedDB for the database and has no backend. It is a front-end only application.
